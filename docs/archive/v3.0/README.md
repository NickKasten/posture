# Archive: v3.0 Planning Documents

This directory contains the comprehensive planning documentation created for the v3.0 agent-driven development approach.

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during an ambitious planning phase that envisioned:
- 11 specialized agent teams working in parallel
- 12-day sprint with 462 tasks
- Hour-by-hour orchestration plans
- Detailed specifications for features not yet built

While valuable for understanding the project vision, these documents:
- Created a 11:1 documentation-to-code ratio
- Described future state rather than current reality
- Consumed excessive context space (20,000+ lines)
- Made it difficult to focus on immediate development needs

## When to Reference These Docs?

These archived documents remain useful for:

- Monetization strategy brainstorming
- Analytics architecture planning

**Principle:** Refer to these when implementing features, not before.
